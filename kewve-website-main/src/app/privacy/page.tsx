            <ol>
              <li>
                Personal data is defined by the REPUBLIC OF IRELAND GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018 (collectively,
                “the Data Protection Legislation”) as ‘any information relating to an identifiable person who can be
                directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to an identifier’.
              </li>
              <li>
                Personal data is, in simpler terms, any information about you that enables you to be identified.
                Personal data covers obvious information such as your name and contact details, but it also covers less
                obvious information such as identification numbers, electronic location data, and other online
                identifiers.
              </li>

            <ol>
              <li>

                <li>
                  The right to be forgotten, i.e. the right to ask us to delete or otherwise dispose of any of your

                  automated means, you can ask us for a copy of that personal data to re-use with another service or

                        All subject access requests should be made in writing and sent to the email or postal addresses

                        There is not normally any charge for a subject access request. If your request is ‘manifestly
                        unfounded or excessive’ (for example, if you make repetitive requests) a fee may be charged to
                        cover our administrative costs in responding.

                      <li>
                        We will respond to your subject access request within 28 days and, in any case, not more than
                        one month of receiving it. Normally, we aim to provide a complete response, including a copy of
                        your personal data within that time. In some cases, however, particularly if your request is
                        more complex, more time may be required up to a maximum of three months from the date we receive
                        your request.

          <h2>Buy Now Pay Later / Extended Payment Terms</h2>
          <h3> Who we share your data with</h3>
          <p>
            If you use our buy now, pay later function or we otherwise provide extended payment terms to you
            (“BNPL Service”), the personal data (including, bank account information) you provide will be processed by
            our third party credit and payment service provider, Kriya Finance Limited (the “BNPL Service Provider”) to
            assess your eligibility for the BNPL Service and for other purposes, including processing of payments in
            connection with the BNPL Service, fraud prevention and identity verification.
          </p>
          <p>
            The BNPL Service Provider may share your personal data with credit reference agencies (“CRA”) they work with
            such as Experian, and may use data about you, and anyone with a financial association to you (a financial
            association is a link that’s created when you apply for a financial agreement with someone else); the BNPL
            Service Provider may also collect this information from other credit reference agencies in order to assist
            in assessing your eligibility for credit and payment services in connection with the BNPL Service. The data
            accessed contains publicly held data including the electoral roll, and shared credit performance data.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a CRA receives a search from us or a BNPL Service Provider to assess your eligibility for the BNPL
            Service, the CRA will place a soft quotation search footprint on your credit report, regardless of whether
            you progress any application. This search will not affect your ability to gain credit.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you choose to pursue an application for the BNPL Service, any data that you provide will be shared with
            our BNPL Service Provider. Upon you making a purchase for goods or services using the BNPL Service, the BNPL
            Service Provider may undertake a search with a CRA which will leave a hard search footprint on your credit
            report. The BNPL Service Provider may also continue to exchange information about your business with CRAs on
            an ongoing basis, including about your settled accounts and any debts not fully repaid on time. CRAs may
            share your information with other organisations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Further information about each CRA and what it does with personal data is available at the following
            locations:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Experian: www.experian.co.uk/legal/crain</li>

            <li>TransUnion: www.transunion.co.uk/crain</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            You can contact any of the CRAs if you wish to obtain a copy of your personal or business credit report.
